# NeuralFaceID
NeuralFaceID is a facial recognition application built entirely in Java without using any external neural network libraries. The goal of the project was to have a deeper understanding of ML principles by creating a dense neural network from scratch, using custom matrix operations and algorithms. NeuralFaceID leverages OpenCV for capturing and preprocessing facial images from a webcam and integrates JavaFX to provide a visual interface.
